## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Task Management System
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for task management in a React.js application. The system allows admins to create tasks and assign them to employees, while employees can accept and view the tasks assigned to them. Data is stored locally using local storage.

## Features
-**Admin Role**: Admins can create tasks, assign them to specific employees, and view/manage all tasks.

-**Employee Role**: Employees can view tasks assigned to them, accept tasks, and mark them as completed.

-**RBAC System**: Role-based access ensures that only admins can create or assign tasks, while employees can only interact with their assigned tasks.

-**Local Storage**: All task data and user roles are stored in the browser's local storage, making the application easy to run without a backend or server.

## Technologies Used
-**Frontend**: React.js

-**Local Storage**: For storing tasks, user roles, and task statuses locally on the user's browser.

-**React Hooks**: For managing application state and side effects.
